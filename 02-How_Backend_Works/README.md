# How Backend works

The backend (or “server-side”) is the portion of the website you don't see. It's responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. The backend communicates with the frontend, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page.

Generally user sends request to server, and server sends back response.
Response header has response code, if 200, response is ok and successfull.
